# LogonEventRegisterer
Fetches preferred data from event viewer locally. (Well at least it tries to...)

This was a side project just to read data from Windows event logs and show who logged in or logged out from machine.
Unfortunately at the time, I had to work on another project so this one just hangs loose here.
I believe that one day I will finish this...
